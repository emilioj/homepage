Hi there! And welcome to my website!

My name is Emilio José Padrón González (Ourense, 1975) and I am
teaching and researching at Universidade da Coruña (UDC) as a member
of the Computer Architecture Group (GAC) and the research center CITIC.
My main topics of interest are in the fields of High Performance
Computing (HPC) and Computer Graphics.

At present, I'm mainly focus on these two research lines:

- High performance data analytics (HPDA and Big Data), applied to
  scientific data from numerical simulations to get an online
  analysis of these data (in-situ and/or in-transit).

- IA applied to computer graphics (mainly, point-based rendering) and
  multimedia.
