abstract = "Recent advances in acquisition technologies such as LiDAR, range cameras and photogrammetry have put point clouds once again in the forefront of several fields with applications in Computer Graphics, Vision and Machine Learning, such as civil engineering, architecture, heritage and archaeology. Taking also into account new progressions in Virtual Reality that are also making VR relevant again, the possibilities when using these two technologies together are endless. From the improvement of architectural workflows, to the conservation of important ancient monuments, these two technologies can improve current efforts substantially. This chapter focuses on how these two fields can be combined in new and innovative ways, so that professionals can optimally exploit the advantages that these improved technologies can offer."
